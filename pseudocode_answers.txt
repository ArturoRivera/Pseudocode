Short Question Answers

1. Programmers write pseudocode to help them write down algorithms in a
language that is mostly english. This helps them get ideas down and breaking
down the steps logically before implementing the code with the correct syntax.
2. The code would not compile because it isn't written in a programming
language.

Programming Assignment

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
INPUT number one
INPUT number two
IF number one is greater than number two
    PRINT number one
ELSE
    PRINT number two

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
INIT number to 1
WHILE number is less than or equal to 100
    PRINT number
    ADD 1 to number
END WHILE

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
CREATE phonebook array
INIT number to search
FOR LOOP
INIT i to zero
     i less than or equal to array length
     INCREMENT i
IF number is equal to phonebook array element
     PRINT number in phonebook
     RETURN true
ELSE PRINT number not in phonebook
     RETURN false  
END FOR LOOP

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any
computer language of your choice.

var phonebookArray = [911, 9129399753, 8378398374];

function isInPhonebook(number) {
    for (i=0; i<phonebookArray.length; i++) {
        if (number === phonebookArray[i]){
          console.log("This number is in the phonebook");
          return true;
        } else {
          console.log("This number is not in the phonebook");
          return false;
        }
    }
}

isInPhonebook(911);
